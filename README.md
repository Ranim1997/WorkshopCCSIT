### General Interfaces
The welcome interface in figure 1 allows the user to select which type of user she/he is to login to the system (e.g., figure 5). The forget password interface in figure 2 allows the user to enter her/his username to receive a token through SMS message based on the number registered in the database when he/she clicks on the “send SMS” button. 
The user will be forwarded to the reset password interface in figure 3, where the token will authenticate the user, and the user will be able to enter the new password.
